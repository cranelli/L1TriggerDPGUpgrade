The Test Directory Stores the configuration files, _cfg.py.

They can be executed with cmsRun.

They should be run in the following order:

particle_gun_gen_sim.py
run_L1TMuon_cfg.py
run_CaloInspector_cfg.py

Each output's a root file, and take's the previous one's root
file as an input.  (So make sure to name them consistently)



Jobs are sent to condor through HOcheck.jdl.

Where the executable is HOcheck.sh.
