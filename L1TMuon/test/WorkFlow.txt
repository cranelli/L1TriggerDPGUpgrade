The Test Directory Stores the configuration files, _cfg.py.

They can be executed with cmsRun.

They should be run in the following order:

particle_gun_gen_sim.py
run_L1TMuon_cfg.py
run_CaloInspector_cfg.py

Each output's a root file, and take's the previous one's root
file as an input.  (So make sure to name them consistently)

To help in this, I have added runParameters.py
Which holds the PREFIX common to all the root files names.
Changing the value of the PREFIX to reflect the current series of tests, 
changes the names of the root files created.

Jobs are sent to condor through HOcheck.jdl.
Where the executable is HOcheck.sh.  
condor_submit HOcheck.jdl
